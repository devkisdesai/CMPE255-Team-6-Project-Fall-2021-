# Abstract

# Introduction
Population studies are among the most ancient methods of examining populationsâ€™ size, structure, and development over time. Researchers have applied statistical examinations on this data to explore mortality, fertility, and their associative factors such as poverty, employment, culture, migration, and religion. Helping them paint a better picture of the modern population and make some predictions about where the population is trending. Many factors play an important role in these predictions including climate change, health services, education, and future well-being. 
Using the current World Bank population estimation data set we aim to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis to shed light on trends, factors, and patterns we see evident in the data. By focusing our attention to modeling and understanding the trends present in the data we allow ourselves to explore a rich sea of information.

# Methods
The idea behind implementing this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis, and figure out some trends that may present across the global population dataset presented by the World Bank. We are currently exploring two methods to project possible trends in the dataset - 
1. Regression
2. Clustering correlation

## Regression:
We propose a method where we analyze the growth in population in individual countries (Possible options: Average growth, Total growth, Growth by a specific year). Then, we would try and correctly identify which continent the specific country belongs to, based on the Continent's respective metrics. This model includes a Prediction Accuracy (FAT 220 Confusion Matrix). According to our assumption, the level of accuracy would be around 60%, given the huge number of countries.

## Clustering correlation
We propose a method where we can try and gauge if a continent can be determined based on its geography. We can try to see if the metrics such as Average growth, Total growth, Growth by a specific year for countries can help us correctly identify what continent the specific country belongs to. Another relation that can be mapped would be gauging what countries are closely related, based on these metrics. Clustering can help determine this correlation and help gauge the similarity in growth in population for specific countries. 

## Visualizations of our data set

- From this histogram, we can learn that how the population growth is distributed for each continent over the years from 1960-2020.

- This bar graph explains to us that how average population growth of the continents over the years 1960-2020.

- From this graph, we can see that trends of population growth year by year from 1961 to 2041 of every continent.

- From this graph, we can see that trends of population growth year by year from 1961 to 2041 of every continent.

- This graph explains that population distribution over countries, where lighter color tells countries which has less population and countries with darker color has more population.

- This graph is the combination of population trends and population growth trends over the years from 1961 to 2046.

- From this graph, we can see that the world population increases linearly over year by year from 1964-2044.

![Trend 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78130620/142963705-3a697049-1abe-439a-8d4c-0caa9bcb98dd.png)
- From this graph, we can see that the rate of change of world population growth decreases gradually over year by year from 1964-2044
