# Abstract

# Introduction
Population studies are among the most ancient methods of examining a populationsâ€™ size, structure, and development over time. Researchers have applied statistical examinations on this type of data to explore mortality, fertility, and their associative factors such as poverty, employment, culture, migration, and religion. This can often result in sweeping changes and action by giving people an understanding of where the modern population is trending towards. Many factors play an important role in developing these projections and predictions including climate change, health services, education, and future well-being.
Using the current World Bank population estimation data set we aim to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis to shed light on trends, factors, and patterns we see evident in the data. By focusing our attention to modeling and understanding the trends present in the data we allow ourselves to explore a rich sea of information. This sea encompasses the ability to understand how nations and continents are tied together; Not only by geography, but by similarity in their population. In this way we aim to research the similarity between populations and modelling their projections.


# Methods
The idea behind implementing this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis and figure out any trends, models, predictions, correlations, and other patterns that may be present across the global population dataset. We are currently exploring two methods to project possible trends in the dataset before exploring further:
1. Regression
2. Clustering Correlation
Notably, the difference between these two methods we are about to present asserts that we would like to make predictions about the population trends with regression, while we would like to use clustering to understand potential similarities between populations.


## Regression:
We propose a method to analyze a population by looking at their individual annual growth either through average growth, total growth, or possible growth entailed by other metrics. This can expanded to many other sections of the data such as migration trends or rural vs urban community trends. Using these types of parameters we aim to conclude information about how globalization may be rapidly increasing certain populations more than others. Through some preliminary analysis we would like to see if we can identify a populations continent of origin. This may give us greater insight into how populations are closely tied to their respective surrounding countries. A model such as the one we are proposing may result in our models achieveing poor accuracy due to the quantity of countries being so low. However, we are assuming the quantity of data per each country will make up this difference.

## Clustering correlation
We propose a method where we attempt to cluster countries by their population data. We believe we can determine this based on their individual metrics given the assumption that countries near one another contain similar population trends. We will use metrics such as average growth, or total growth among a multitude of others that may help us correctly identify what continent the specific country belongs to. Another relation that can be mapped would be gauging what countries are closely related, based on these metrics. Clustering can help determine this correlation and help gauge the similarity in growth in population for specific countries. 


## Visualizations of our data set


![Growth by continent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78130620/142963621-549022c2-8a6c-4e73-bc00-a36257d09991.png)
- This histogram contains information regarding the distribution of Total Growth over an 60 year period, from 1960-2020, by continent. This visualization demonstrates how each continents population has been growing overall. While a notable aspect includes a few European countries declining over this period. Further analysis can be done to understand why that is the case.

![Average growth by continent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78130620/142963637-9699f037-d0a8-49e3-a3bd-b4f83e748a39.png)
- This bar graph demonstrates each continents average population growth over the years 1960-2020. It is important to note that this does not take into account starting or ending population sizes, just their respective growths.

![Trend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78130620/142963653-c7d9522f-6fee-4b5f-b789-185029967757.png)
- This graph elaborates on the previous graphs visualzation. It helps visualize how population growth rates have been in an overall decline from 1961-2020. Notably we can see jumps throughout the graph which may be the result of political action giving a higher quality of life and subsequently leading to an increase in birth rates.

- This graph demonstrates the density of human the population distribution throughout each country. Lighter colors entail countries with smaller populations while darker countries have a larger population.

![Trend 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78130620/142963692-ffe62d49-72ce-494d-8346-5a21bd8a7227.png)
- From this graph, we can see that the world population has increased linearly year by year from 1964-2050.

![Trend 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78130620/142963705-3a697049-1abe-439a-8d4c-0caa9bcb98dd.png)
- This graph demonstrates world growth trends from 1964-2050. Notably it is in a nearly constant state of decline and all data points after the year 2020 are predictions based on the trajectory given the previous trends of growth.

![Trend 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78130620/142963682-3101d4d1-81be-4d7d-af1f-5054922894f0.png)
- This graph is a combination of the previous two figures from 1964-2050. It demonstrates that while the world growth rate is in decline, our population continues to increase as a result of over population.
