# Abstract

# Introduction
Population studies are among the most ancient methods of examining populations’ size, structure, and development over time. Researchers have applied statistical examinations on this data to explore mortality, fertility, and their associative factors such as poverty, employment, culture, migration, and religion. Helping them paint a better picture of the modern population and make some predictions about where the population is trending. Many factors play an important role in these predictions including climate change, health services, education, and future well-being. 
Using the current World Bank population estimation data set we aim to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis to shed light on trends, factors, and patterns we see evident in the data. By focusing our attention to modeling and understanding the trends present in the data we allow ourselves to explore a rich sea of information.
